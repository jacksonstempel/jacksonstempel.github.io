            <p>I find myself in a strange time.</p>

            <p>I was born at the end of everything that came before; at the beginning of all that is to come.</p>

            <p>I often ask myself, where is everyone?</p>

            <p>Many people suggest many explanations.</p>

            <p>But no matter what...</p>

            <p>I cannot avoid the conclusion that we are unique.</p>

            <p>That none of this has happened before.</p>

            <p>The universe is ripe for the taking. Matter and energy, in unbelievable quantities, just...sitting there. The Earth was once the same. But billions of years ago, one self-reproducing bubble arose from a hydrothermal vent. These bags of chemicals, unlike any chemicals before them, took over the Earth, evolved, and persisted for billions of years. Why?</p>

            <p>Life happens for the same reason everything else happens. Entropy favors it. But life is just a bit cleverer. Living systems accelerate the production of entropy from free energy, creating beautiful but fleeting structure in the process. But in the end, life persists because the universe is more stable after life is done with it.</p>

            <p>Once that seed of life arises, it expands and expands, dissipating energy as it goes. That first cell was like a tiny bubble in a bottle of supercooled water. The water appears stable, but it is only metastable. When a bubble arises, providing a surface upon which molecules may crystallize, the favorable freezing process propagates in all directions until the entire bottle is frozen. Just so, life replicated in all directions until this rock was saturated with it.</p>

            <p>I think the universe is metastable in a similar way. Just as that first cell catalyzed Earth's energy gradients, so too might intelligence catalyze the universe's. I just can't figure out why no one has yet produced the seed. A phase transition, from barren planets and unoccupied stars to whatever structures advanced lifeforms shall produce, has not yet happened. This is somewhat surprising.</p>

            <p>The stars and galaxies are huge wells of free energy waiting to be converted to homogeneous nothingness. They will eventually do this on their own, but the universe wouldn't mind if someone decided to help it along. All it takes is one species, from one planet. Once the probes are sent out, there is no going back. A sphere of intelligent exploitation shall expand at near-light speed, catalyzing this inevitable great phase transition. The first to do it will inherit the cosmos.</p>

            <p>But we don't see any probes.</p>

            <p>The universe is 13.8 billion years old. Our species, only 200,000. Modern technology has existed for but a blink of the universal eye. Yet already we are expanding into space, and our science, as we currently understand it, places no steadfast barriers towards the production of self-replicating probes. Barring accidental self-annihilation, it is likely we will be capable enough to send out universe-colonizing probes within decades, or perhaps sooner yet given the progress in AI.</p>

            <p>What is stopping us? Why does it seem so easy to colonize the universe? If it's this easy, why has no one else done it?</p>

            <p>Have I really been born, not just as a member of that special first species to take the universe, but as one among the few to witness that short period of time in which the great phase transition begins?</p>

            <p>I doubt it. But why does it seem that way?</p>

            <p>Why does technology keep improving, without a fundamental roadblock in sight?</p>

            <p>It all seems too easy to not have been done before. Intelligence seems too powerful to be allowed to exist. Artificial intelligence, even more so. And yet we exist. And yet AI continues to get smarter.</p>

            <p>How mysterious this world is.</p>

            <p>And how strange it is to stand in it, the universe aware of itself.</p>

            <p>Like a water molecule, moving more sluggishly than should be allowed...</p>

            <p>Suspicious, that a change is bound to come.</p>
